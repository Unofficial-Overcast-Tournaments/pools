# 3v3 Tournament

## Gamemodes
In this tournament, there are nine gamemodes:
- CTF
- CTW
- Flag Assault
- Flag Football
- KotF
- KotH
- Painters
- TDM
- Team Fights

## Format
The format is best-of-five (first to three wins) of gamemodes; there is one map per gamemode. The tournament is a single elimination, once you lose a round you are permanently eliminated.

## Veto system
Each round has a veto system. You will play a match on `Charge: TE` in order to determine who chooses which maps to ban/pick first. After the match, the teams take turns banning maps, with the winning team going first - each team bans two maps. After, the teams take turns picking which maps to play in order, with the winning team going first again.

## Commands
The command to ban/pick a map is `/veto <number>`. The number will be displayed in chat. It will look like this:
